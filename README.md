# CNN-for-Recognizing-and-Predicting-Flower-Types

In this project, flower recognition and prediction is implemented using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of 5 different types of flowers totaling upto ~240MBs in data size, with the project aimed at implementing supervised machine learning technique in this data mining task by predicting the type of any given flower based on its given image. Sequential model using Keras shall be built and used as the base model for this CNN-based project.

Conclusion

The results of the project show that the Convolutional Neural Network model was able to achieve a high degree of accuracy in both recognizing and predicting the five different types of flowers in the dataset. The model was able to train and test on the dataset with an accuracy score of 73.77%. This accuracy score is a testament to the effectiveness of the CNN model in recognizing and predicting the kinds of flowers contained in the dataset. The project has shown that the CNN model is a viable choice for recognizing and predicting flower types. The model may also be used to classify and predict other flower species in the future, as well as other types of objects. Overall, this project has demonstrated the potential of CNNs in flower recognition and prediction and has provided a successful tool for identifying, predicting, and classifying different kinds of flowers. In the future, more experiments and analysis can be done to further improve the accuracy of the flower recognition model.
